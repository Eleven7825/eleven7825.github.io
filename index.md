Hello, I am a junior undergraduate student majored in Honors Mathmematics. I am also a member of Applied Math Lab at NYU Shanghai. Currently, I am working on a project on material dissolving and natural circulation. We are seeking for a model to explain the periodic flow structure as we found during our previous experiment.

Besides a student, I am also a rock climber. If you are Shanghai and also a climber, you are more than welcomed to contact me to team up and climb some crazy routes, either gym or near by crags. Gear provided!
