Hello, I'm Shiyi Chen, but feel free to call me Eleven. I'm currently graduated from M.S.E. in Mechanical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, with a background in Honors Mathematics from New York University Shanghai.
My passions lie in math modeling, simulation, and computational biology, you can see a list of my previous undergraduate projects on the [project page](https://eleven7825.github.io/projectpage/). Currently I am a research assistant at Johns Hopkins University at Natalia Trayanova's Computational Cardiology lab. My research focused on the stroke risk prediction of the left atrium.
When I'm not working on projects, you can find me hiking, camping, climbing, or skateboarding. I'm always up for meeting new people and making friends from all over the world!
