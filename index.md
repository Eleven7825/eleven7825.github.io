Hello, this is Eleven Chen from NYU Shanghai. Currently, I am studying away in New York City. My major is Honors Mathematics. Math modeling and Simulation are my favorites while I have also done some experimental physics projects in the lab before.

I am also a backpacker, sport climber(truelly want to try trad though...), and skateboarder. Open to new friends from all over the world!
