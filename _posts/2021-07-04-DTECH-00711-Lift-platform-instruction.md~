## Prereqs

You'll need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) on your machine. If you want to borrow our docker-compose.yml file, you can copy from this [repository](https://github.com/pennchildlanglab/docker-compose-demo), or clone it using 

```
git clone https://github.com/pennchildlanglab/docker-compose-demo.git
```
