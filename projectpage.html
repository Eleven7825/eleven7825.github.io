  <h2> A DEMONSTRATION OF PARAMETRIC RESONANCE </h2>
  <p> In this project, we demonstrate the parametric resonance of a 2D elastic ring using the existing implementation of immersed boundary method. The ring is constructed using the zero-length Hookean springs, the ring is immersed in a square domain of fluid. This setup is analogous to a three-dimensional water balloon immersed in water. As for the dimension of the setup, the size of the square is 1 cm times 1 cm, the size of the fingernail. The boundary of the square is periodic, meaning that water flowing up out of the domain will flow into the domain in the bottom again. Similar for the left and right.</p>
